		Each player takes on the role of a Villager, a Werewolf, or a special character.
		It's your job to figure out who the Werewolves are and to kill them all in order to win... unless youâ€™ve
		become a Werewolf yourself.
		<br>
		The game will proceed in an alternating day and night cycle, beginning with night-time. The roles will be
		called during the night and
		during the day you must discuss the outcome of the previous night, then vote on who to lynch.
		There are no restrictions on speech. Any living player can say anything they want -- truth, misdirection,
		nonsense, or a barefaced lie.
		Dead players may not speak at all.

<div class="collapse" id="roles">

		<div class="card" style="width: 25rem;">
			<h3 class="card-title">Werewolf</h3><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/Werewolf.png') }}" class="card-img-top"
				alt="werewolf" height="350px">
			<div class="card-body">Typically werewolves are outnumbered by villagers 2 to 1. So a game of 6 players
				would have 2 werewolves.
				The goal of the werewolves is to decide together on one villager to secretly kill off during the
				night,
				while posing as villagers during the day so they're not killed off themselves. One by one they'll
				kill
				off villagers and win when there are either the same number of villagers and werewolves left, or all
				the
				villagers have died.
				This role is the hardest of all to maintain, because these players are lying for the duration of the
				game. </div>
		</div>
		<div class="card" style="width: 25rem;">
			<h3 class="card-title">Villager</h3><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/Villager.png') }}" class="card-img-top"
				alt="villager" height="350px">
			<div class="card-body">The most commonplace role, a simple Villager, spends the game trying to root out
				who
				they believe the werewolves (and other villagers) are. While they do not need to lie, the role
				requires
				players to keenly sense and point out the flaws or mistakes of their fellow players. Someone is
				speaking
				too much? Could mean they're a werewolf. Someone isn't speaking enough? Could mean the same thing.
				It
				all depends on the people you're playing with, and how well you know them. </div>
		</div>
		<div class="card" style="width: 25rem;">
			<h3 class="card-title">Seer</h3><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/Seer.png') }}" class="card-img-top" alt="seer" height="350px">
			<div class="card-body">
				The Seer, while first and foremost a villager, has the added ability to
				see one of their fellow players role each night.
				The Seer can then choose to keep this information a secret during the day, or reveal
				themselves as the Seer and use the knowledge they gained during the night in their defence
				or to their advantage during the day. The strategy here is up to you. </div>
		</div>
		<div class="card" style="width: 25rem;">
			<h3 class="card-title">Doctor</h3><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/Doctor.png') }}" class="card-img-top" alt="doctor" height="350px">
			<div class="card-body">Also a villager, the Doctor has the ability to heal themselves or another
				villager when called awake during the night. Should they heal themselves, then will
				be safe from being killed by the werewolves, or should they want to prove themselves the Doctor or
				fear the death of a fellow villager, can opt to heal them instead. Again, the strategy here is up to
				you. </div>

			<h3 class="card-title">Cupid</h3><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/Cupid.png') }}" class="card-img-top" alt="cupid" height="350px">
			<div class="card-body">Cupid does not actually count as a special role, but they are aligned with the
				Villagers. The Cupid is awoken on the first day only. They then
				pick 2 players to be lovers. These 2 players are then awoken and see each other. For the rest of the
				game, if one lover dies, so does the other. After the first night, the
				Cupid plays the remainder of the game as a normal Villager. </div>
		</div>
		<div class="card" style="width: 25rem;">
			<h3 class="card-title">Hunter</h3><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/Hunter.png') }}" class="card-img-top" alt="hunter" height="350px">
			<div class="card-body">The Hunter is a villager, who when killed (during the day) takes their bow and
				arrow, and kills one other person with their dying breath. The target must be chosen quickly and
				without intervention from the rest of the village. Any protection the target may have received
				during the night phase no longer applies, and the target will be killed regardless of any other
				factors. </div>
